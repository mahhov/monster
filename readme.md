# Monster

## Description

This is a human v.s. monster game. You, the human, are stuck in a house, looking for the exit before the monster finds you. The monster runs faster and can see in the dark, whereas the human can only see within the short range that his light reaches. The monster can sniff the human's approximate location (more accurate the closer the human is) every couple seconds.
